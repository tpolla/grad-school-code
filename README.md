# grad-school-code
This repository is meant to store the code I've written in Grad School.

For my Master's in Applied Data Science with a Specialization in Sports Analytics, I'll be using the repository to track code I've written. The folders will be broken down by specific classes and projects.

The majority of the code in this repository will be written in SQL and Python.
